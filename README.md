# unicodify-clj

This is a program specifically designed to adapt `wget -r` dumps of old websites with the legacy Devanagari encoding XDVNG so that they use unicode instead. It has only been tested on the contents of [Malhar](http://www.hindi-urdu-malhar.org).

## Usage

**First**, modify the variables in unicodify-clj.core to suit your machine.

Then, `lein run`
