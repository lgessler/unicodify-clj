# unicodify-clj

This is a program specifically designed to adapt `wget -r` dumps of old websites with the legacy Devanagari encoding XDVNG so that they use unicode instead. It has only been tested on the contents of [Malhar](https://github.com/lgessler/unicodify-clj/tree/master/www.hindi-urdu-malhar.org).

## Usage

**First**, modify the variables in unicodify-clj.core to suit your machine. `INPUT_PATH` should point to the root dir of where you put the contents of Malhar.

Then, `lein run`. (Get [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/).)

I haven't tested this on Windows. It probably won't work without changes.
