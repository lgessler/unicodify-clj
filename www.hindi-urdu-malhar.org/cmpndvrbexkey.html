<center>Key to exercise on compound verbs and their meanings. </center>
<p>

&nbsp;la. The compound form बैठ जाइए gives a more peremptory tone to a command addressed
to a stranger.  &nbsp;See discussion of example (16) in <a href="cmpndvrb.html#016">Notes</a> <p>

&nbsp;lb. The non-compound form बैठिए is appropriate when addressing an older relative 
who is perfectly willing to co-operate. <p>

&nbsp;2a.The non-compound form की is much to be preferred since Columbus's discovery 
of what we have come to know as "America" was unforeseen (and unforeseeable) at the time.  
Columbus, believing he had reached Asia, did not know that he had discovered a new continent. 
&nbsp;See discussion of examples (4) and (5) in <a href="cmpndvrb.html#003">Notes</a>
<p>

&nbsp;2b.The compound form कर ली because the statement contrasts Leif Ericson's 
discovery of America as occurring <b>before</b> Columbus's 
discovery of it. &nbsp;See discussion of examples (9) and (10) in 
<a href="cmpndvrb.html#009">Notes</a><p>

&nbsp;3a.The compound form कर लेते is appropriate because the second clause 
introduces an activity that is an exception to that in the first clause. &nbsp; 
See discussion of example (14) in <a href="cmpndvrb.html#010">Notes</a> <p>

&nbsp;3b.  The writer does not present Kabir's occupation [he was a weaver in Varanasi] 
as being a departure from his writing poetry. The activities of working and writing were 
both normal parts of his life.  For this reason the non-compound form करते is to be preferred 
to the compound  कर लेते. <p>

&nbsp;4a. The host guesses that his guests will arrive after 2:30 o'clock  so the compound form 
पहुँचेंगे is appropriate.  &nbsp;See discussion of example (11)  in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#009">
Notes</a> <p>

&nbsp;4b. The speaker claims that the guests will arrive before 8 or 9 o'clock has struck 
so the compound form पहुँच जाएँगे is appropriate.  &nbsp;See discussion of examples (9) and (10) 
in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#009">Notes</a> <p> 

&nbsp;5a.  Use of a compound verb in the past tense implies successful completion of the action 
it refers to.  Thus only the non-compound form खोला is possible when the following clause negates it. 
&nbsp;See discussion of example (6) in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#004">Notes</a> 
<p>

&nbsp;5b. Roopchand's action of opening the door precedes his visitors' knocking on it. 
Hence the compound form  खोल दिया is appropriate.  &nbsp;See discussion of examples (9) and (10) 
in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#009">Notes</a> <p>

&nbsp;6a.  By paying a tonga driver to take him there the writer arrives easily at his destination.  
In such a situation the compound form पहुँच गया is felicitous (although the non-compound is also 
possible). &nbsp;See discussion of examples (12) and (13) in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#012">Notes</a> 
<p>

&nbsp;6b. Traveling via a mountain road the writer has had trouble getting to where 
he wanted to go so the non-compound form पहुँचा is more likely than the compound पहुँच गया. <p>

&nbsp;7a. The first clause "sets up" the event in the second clause as a salient result of the explosion. 
&nbsp;See example (7) in the <a href="cmpndvrb.html#007">Notes</a> <p>

&nbsp;7b. The main point of this part of the report is that no-one was in the room at the time the roof fell, 
hence the non-compound form गिरी is more likely than the compound गिर गई.  Generally speaking, 
position inside a relative clause decreases the likelihood that a verb will occur in compound form. <p>  


<!-- &nbsp;2a. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">j:l: g:y:&#240;</font>, since the
effect of the action on the victims is exhaustive. (They have died as a
result of the fire.) <br>

&nbsp;2b. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">j:l:a </font> because the
action of the fire on the speaker is presented (&nbsp;by the use of
&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">es:f&#252;</font> . . .&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">
j:l:a</font>&nbsp;) as limited in scope. <p>

(from here on the key is still under revision) <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> p:`a </font> . The speaker is inviting the addressee to read
in the Ramayana rather than through it. 3b: &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> p:` el:y:a </font>. Here note that V - &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> n:&#240; s:&#240; p:hl:&#240; </font> and &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> p:&#220;ra </font> are promoting the compound
form. <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4a: &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> c:a&#240;ri h&#216;I </font> would be
normal unless the speaker was waiting to be robbed. 4b: &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> c:a&#240;ri ha&#240; g:I </font> agrees with the
irony of &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> AaeQ:r </font> . <p> 

&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> kXa el:y:&#240; </font> with &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng"> AaeQ:r </font> suggests a prior period of resistance. 5b:
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> kXaO </font> subsumes the haircut
under the larger act of barbering which was rounded off with a shampoo.
<p> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 6a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> Ap:n:&#240; p:as: rK: l:a&#240; </font> suggests
forethought and anticipation of accidents. 6b: &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng">rK:a&#240; </font> is appropriate to action without visible
effect ( cf. &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> p:&#224;Tv:i c:a&#248;d
ka&#240; Ap:n:i Aa&#240;r K:i&#248;c:t:i h&#242; .</font> ) . <p> 

&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 7a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1"
FACE="Xdvng">p:k_a </font> is better, especially if grabbing the hand is
seen as subsidiary part of the act of walking together. 7b: &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> p:k_ el:y:a </font> brings out the anticipation of
escape and the fear of getting caught. <p> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 8a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> K:aAa&#240;
</font> because eating the candy is presented as good in itself. 8b:
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> K:a l:a&#240; </font> here because
eating the candy is seen as a means to some ends. <p>

 &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 9a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng">
edK:aI d&#240; g:y:&#240;  </font> , especially if the kite spots him in
spite of the rabbit's efforts to stay out of sight. 9b: &nbsp;<FONT
SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> edK:aI di&#248; </font> , since the flames are in
plain sight of the former house-owners. <p> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; 10a: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> d&#240;t:i
h&#242; </font>. The speaker is taking pleasure in the fact itself. 10b:
&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Xdvng"> d&#240; d&#240;t:i h&#242; </font> ,
in contrast, suggests the speaker's feelings of frustration. <p>

--->

<!-- &nbsp;13a. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">ha&#240; g:y:a</font>, since
the prior clause indicates that the speaker (and hearer) had been
expecting what happened to happen.  See <FONT
FACE="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s short story <FONT
FACE="Xdvng">t:&#240;&#248;t:r</font>, second page, line 16. <p> -->

<!-- &nbsp;13b. &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">h&#216;Aa </font> because the
presence of &nbsp;<FONT FACE="Xdvng">hi</font>&nbsp; as a
delimiting particle (incorporated in &nbsp;<FONT
FACE="Xdvng">v:hi</font>&nbsp;) tends to suppress the use of a
compound verb, even when other factors (such as the expression of
fear) favor it. See <FONT FACE="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s
short story <FONT FACE="Xdvng">t:&#240;&#248;t:r</font>, first
line of first page.  <p> -->
