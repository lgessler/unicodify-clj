&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was standing in the park with (my) hands
stuck ( <font face="Xdvng">Ral:</font> ) in (my) pockets. I ( <font
face="Xdvng">m:&#216;J:&#240;</font> ) had already been two (or) three
hours wandering (through) the whole bazaar in search ( <font
face="Xdvng">t:l:aS: m:&#240;&#248;</font> ) of a book written by a
professor of mine. How old and tired my professor looked ( <font
face="Xdvng">l:g:</font> ) and still his books didn't sell.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I saw her (as she was) getting down from a
moving bus. She was wearing a beautiful ( <font
face="Xdvng">Q:&#220;b:s:&#220;rt:</font> ) red dress. I watched ( <font
face="Xdvng">d&#240;K:t:a rh</font> ) her cross the street with ( <font
face="Xdvng">el:y:&#240; h&#216;O</font> ) a silk ( <font
face="Xdvng">r&#240;S:m:</font> ) umbrella and sweater knit from ( <font
face="Xdvng">ka</font> ) wool in (her) hand. Going toward the river, she
stopped by a bridge made of stone.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Suddenly someone screamed ( <font
face="Xdvng">ec:ll:a</font> ) and she began to run toward a man drowning
in the water. Catching his hand, she pulled ( <font
face="Xdvng">K:i&#248;c: l:a</font> ) him out of the water. Then she saw
that he was holding on to a large floating piece ( <font
face="Xdvng">X&#216;k_a</font> ) of wood. And then I saw that the man's
smiling face was my old, tired professor's!<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When I left, the two of them, sitting among
the flowers, were talking and basking in the sun ( <font
face="Xdvng">D:&#220;p: s:&#240;k</font> ).<p>
