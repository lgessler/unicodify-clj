<center> Conceding a point with &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font>
</center> <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In colloquial Hindi-Urdu the particle
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> is used after &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">hi</font>, &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">n:</font>, and
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">t:a&#240;</font> to express two or three kinds of
concession and after &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">t:a&#240;</font> with an
imperative in order to cajole or insist. &nbsp;These related uses are
examined and exemplified here. &nbsp;The problem of where &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> comes from is also briefly discussed. <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: &nbsp;Concession along a scale of
desirability.  &nbsp;Use of &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">hi s:hi</font> and /
or &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">n: s:hi</font> creates an implicit scale on
which the speaker places the option he or she accepts below the option
that would have been preferred. &nbsp;In (1) the speaker concedes that his
wife's gifts to her sisters-in-law were not top of the line: <p>

<a name=02808>

&nbsp;1. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">Ap:n:i d&#240;h p:r g:hn:&#240; k&#241;
n:am: kcc:a D:ag:a B:i n: T:a</font>, &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">d&#240;v:raen:y:a&#240;&#248; k&#241; el:O
da&#240;</font>-<font face="Xdvng">da&#240; c:ar</font>-<font
face="Xdvng">c:ar <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; g:hn:&#240; b:n:v:a edy:&#240;.
&nbsp;s:a&#240;n:&#240; k&#241; n: s:hi</font>, &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">c:a&#250;di k&#241; t:a&#240; h&#242;&#248;.</font> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'There wasn't even a bit of string on her body that
you could call an ornament, yet she had three <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; or four pieces of jewelry made for her younger
sisters-in-law.  Okay, (I'll grant you,) they're made <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of silver, not gold.' <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (from Chapter Three of &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">g:a&#240;dan:</font>. See <a
href="godan03.html#02804">context</a>.) <br>

In (2) the speaker concedes that he can no longer expect friendship from
the person he's addressing: <p>

<a name=17513>

&nbsp;2. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">m:&#242;&#248; Ab: t:k Aap:ka&#240;
em:*: s:m:J:t:a Aay:a T:a</font>; &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">m:g:r Ab: Aap:
l:_n:&#240; hi p:r t:&#242;y:ar h&#242;&#248;</font>, &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">t:a&#240; <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; l:_aI hi s:hi. </font> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Up till now I've considered you a friend; but now
you are bent on fighting with me. &nbsp;So<br> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;let there be a fight.' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
(from Chapter Sixteen of &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">g:a&#240;dan:</font>.
See <a href="godan16.html#17509">context</a>.) <br>

In (3) - whose proper interpretation requires some acquaintance with the
themes and conventions of the classic Urdu <i>ghazal</i> - the poet
expresses his willingness to accept rejection, if only to demonstrate 
thereby the depth of his passion: <p>

<a name=sher08>

&nbsp;3. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">g:r n:hi&#248; v:s:l: t:a&#240; hs:rt:
hi s:hi</font> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'If I can't be united (with the one I love), okay,
I'll take on (the duty of) longing (for him / her).' <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (from a &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">^:z:l:</font>&nbsp;
by &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">^:ael:b:</font>. See <a
href="^zlinat.html#06">context</a>.) <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From these three examples, we can see that, first of
all, use of &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> implies (or creates) a
scale of desirability between two options (gold and silver; friendship and
enmity, union and longing). &nbsp;Second, the phrase &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">n: s:hi</font> follows the more desirable of these options,
while &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">hi s:hi</font> follows the less desirable.
&nbsp;And, third, the speaker accepts (wistfully, willingly, or defiantly)
the less desirable one. <p>

<a name=sher06>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is possible to use both &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">n: s:hi</font> &nbsp;and &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">hi
s:hi</font> &nbsp;simultaneously: <br>

&nbsp;4. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">n: s:hi ESq</font>, &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">m:&#216;s:ib:t: hi s:hi</font> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Okay, if I can't have (the joy of) love, then
I'll take pain (if it is your pleasure to inflict pain on me).' <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (from &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">^:ael:b:</font>. See
<a href="^zlinat.html#04">context</a>.) <br>

<a name=sher03>

&nbsp;5. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">ePr B:i m:&#216;J:&#240; rh</font>-<font
face="Xdvng">rhkr ^:&#216;ss:a Aa rha T:a ek m:&#242;&#248; 
g:a&#240;ri n: s:hi</font>, &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">eb:l:k&#217;l: kal:i
s:hi</font> . . . <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Still, again and again I felt angry that I
was, okay, not light, but actually, completely dark...' <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Thanks to Terry Varma for this example from
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">ka&#240;l:t:ar</font>.) <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The implicit scale of desirability created by
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> is the source of the humor in
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">^:ael:b:</font>'s cheeky sher: <br>

&nbsp;6. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">m:&#240;r&#240; ha&#240;n:&#240;
m:&#240;&#248; h&#242; Vy:a ,s:v:aI</font> ? <font face="Xdvng"><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;O&#242;</font>, &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">v:h m:j:el:s:
n:hi&#248;</font>, &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">eQ:l:v:t: hi s:hi </font> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Why should you be embarrassed by my presence?
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; All right, if not in public (I'll settle
for meeting) in private!' &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (See <a
href="^zlinat.html#03">context</a>.) <p>

For discussion of another construction, whose use creates an implicit
scale of likelihood or plausibility, see <a
href="auratoaura.html">notes</a> on &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">Aa&#242;r
t:a&#240; Aa&#242;r</font> . <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B. &nbsp;Rhetorical concession. &nbsp;As
with other expressions of concession, &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font>
may be employed as a rhetorical device, as a tactic in arguing or
negotiating. &nbsp;In (7), for instance, speaker B uses &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">s:hi</font>&nbsp; in conceding that, indeed, her husband had
to put up with a lot of social and family opposition when he married her,
but then goes on to remind him that she, too, made a sacrifice: <p>

<a name=35637>

&nbsp;7. &nbsp; " <font face="Xdvng">l:_aI t:&#240;r&#240; karn: h&#216;I.
</font> " <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " <font face="Xdvng">AcCa</font>, &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">m:&#240;r&#240; hi karn: s:hi. &nbsp;m:&#242;&#248;n:&#240;
B:i t:a&#240; t:&#216;mhar&#240; el:O Ap:n:a G:r</font>-<font
face="Xdvng">b:ar Ca&#240;_ edy:a.</font> " <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: "I had to struggle because of you." <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B: "Yes, you did struggle because of me. &nbsp;But I
also had to give up my home and family for you." <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (from Chapter Thirty-five of &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">g:a&#240;dan:</font>. See <a
href="godan35.html#35634">context</a>.) <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Concessive &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> may
be used to conciliate or persuade an addressee: <br>

<a name=06609>

&nbsp; 8. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">Aa&#242;r k&#217;C n: s:hi</font>,
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">t:m:aS:a t:a&#240; rh&#240;g:a.</font> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; '(C'mon,) if nothing else, it will be great fun (to 
see what happens)!' <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (from Chapter Six of &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">g:a&#240;dan:</font>. See <a
href="godan06.html#06605">context</a>.) <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a colloquial rhetorical device, &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> typically occurs in conversational exchanges.
&nbsp;However, even inside a single turn a speaker may introduce a clause
set off with &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> as a foil in order to
strengthen a point.  &nbsp;In (9), for example, the speaker could have
simply made an observation about the social difficulties occasioned by
letting a daughter go unmarried. &nbsp;Instead he dramatizes his point by
creating a contrast between that and its opposite, failing to marry a son.
&nbsp;This contrast is sharpened by use of the phrase &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">n: s:hi</font> : <br>

<a name=03220>

&nbsp;9. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">l:_k&#241; ka by:ah n: h&#216;Aa</font>,
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">n: s:hi. &nbsp;l:_ki ka by:ah n:
h&#216;Aa</font>, &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">t:a&#240; s:ari eb:radri
m:&#240;&#248; h&#250;s:i ha&#240;g:i.</font> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Don't marry a son and it's okay. &nbsp;Don't marry a
daughter and the whole caste laughs at you.' <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (from Chapter Four of &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">g:a&#240;dan:</font>. See <a
href="godan04.html#03216">context</a>.) <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C. &nbsp;Dismissive concession. &nbsp;If the
one who concedes a point is sufficiently defiant about it, &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> may take on sarcastic force: 'Let it be!' (ie, 'I
don't care!', 'So what!'): <p>

<a name=26345>

10. "&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">t:a&#240; us: ka&#240;Yri ka
ekray:a ha&#240;g:a ka&#240;I p:c:as: ,p:O m:hin:a</font> ! "<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">us:ka ekray:a Ok
p:&#242;s:a s:hi. </font>" <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dhaniy&acirc;: '... So I suppose that house's rent is
50 rupees a month!' <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hor&icirc;: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Let it be one paisa
per month!' &nbsp;(ie, 'It doesn't matter one bit what the rent is!')
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (from Chapter Twenty-four of &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">g:a&#240;dan:</font>. See <a
href="godan24.html#26341">context</a>.) <br>

This kind of aggressive concession may be taken as an attack on the
interlocutor's thought processes: 'Sure, I'll concede your point, since
it has nothing to do with the argument at hand!' <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; D. &nbsp;Hedges and reservations: &nbsp;Using
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> or &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">t:a&#240;
s:hi</font> with the subjunctive may concede the logic of the
interlocutor's argument at the same time that it questions the validity of
its premise: <p>

11. "&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">Ab: y:&#240; ,p:O c:&#216;k
j:aO&#251;g:&#240; t:a&#240;</font> . . . "<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">t:a&#240; B:i k&#217;C n:
k&#217;C ha&#240; hi j:aOg:a. &nbsp;AB:i v:h v:]t: AaO t:a&#240; s:hi.
</font> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A: 'And when this money runs out, then...?' <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; B: 'Then we'll manage one way or another. &nbsp;But
first let that time come!' <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (Thanks to Terry Varma for this example.) <p>

The speaker may use &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">t:a&#240; s:hi</font> with
the subjunctive to concede that his own premise may not be valid.
&nbsp;The equivalent in English is 'provided that...' or 'just let...' <p>

12. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">m:&#242;&#248; us:ki Q:b:r
l:&#220;&#250;g:a. &nbsp;v:h y:ha&#250; AaO t:a&#240; s:hi</font> ! <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I'll fix his wagon. Just let him come here!'
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; E.  &nbsp;Cajoling: &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> can be used with &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">t:a&#240;</font> in imperatives to create a tone of
insistence or entreaty: <br>

13. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">j:akr d&#240;K:a&#240; t:a&#240;
s:hi</font> ! <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Go and have a look, would you!' <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (from &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">eS:x:aT:i&#252; ehndi
A&#250;g:r&#240;z:i S:bdka&#240;S:</font> by &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">hrd&#240;v: <a href="refdex.html#Bahri">b:ahri</font></a> )
<br>

Terry Varma observes that with an imperative the same &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">t:a&#240; s:hi</font> may function to reassure: <br>

14. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">AaAa&#240; t:a&#240; s:hi</font> ! <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Come on! (There's nothing to be afraid of.)'
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; F. &nbsp;Sources of &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">s:hi</font>: &nbsp; Analysis of the semantic and discoursal
functions of &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> is complicated by the
existence of another word with the same pronunciation and a similar
meaning: <p>

<a name=32335>

15. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">m:al:&#220;m: n:hi&#248; kha&#250; t:k
s:hi h&#242; </font>. . .<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I don't know how much truth there is in it.'
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (from Chapter Thirty-one of
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">)&#240;m:c:nd</font>'s &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">g:a&#240;dan:</font>. See <a
href="godan31.html#32331">context</a>.) <br>

This &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font>, meaning 'true, correct;
healthy, sound; whole, entire'  is from Arabic [and in Urdu has a spelling
different from the &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> of exx (1-14)]:
<br>

16. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi B:av: b:t:aAa&#240;</font> !<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Tell me the true price!' (line often used in
bargaining) <p>

17. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">hm: s:hi</font>-<font
face="Xdvng">s:l:am:t: p:h&#216;&#250;c: g:O.</font> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'We arrived safe and sound.' <p>

Conjectured sources for the &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> of exx
(1-14) include the Hindi-Urdu verb &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:h</font>-
'bear, tolerate' &nbsp;(&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng"><a
href="refdex.html#MHK">m:an:k ehndi ka&#240;S:</a></font>&nbsp;),
&nbsp;the Sanskrit participle &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">es:&#185;</font>
'ready; accomplished; perfect' &nbsp;(&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">m:an:k
ehndi ka&#240;S:</font>&nbsp;), and &nbsp;a survival (of the subjunctive
form?) of the verb &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">As:</font>- &nbsp;'be'
(Fallon's Urdu dictionary). &nbsp;In his dictionary of Hindi R.S. McGregor
seems to assume that all instances of &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font>
come from the Arabic &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hih</font>. &nbsp;My own
theory is that the &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:hi</font> of exx (1-14) is
the combination of the demonstrative pronoun &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">s:a&#240;</font> &nbsp;'that (one)' and the particle
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">hi</font> as in: <br>

18. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:a&#240; t:a&#240; h&#242; hi</font> !
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; => ? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">h&#242;
t:a&#240; s:hi</font> ! <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Well, I agree. That is the way it is!' <p>
