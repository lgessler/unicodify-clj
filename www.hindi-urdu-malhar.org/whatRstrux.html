(NOTE: &nbsp;To download (for free) a version of Netsacpe 4.x that best
displays the Xdvng Devanagari font from "SillyDog701", click <a
href="http://sillydog.org/narchive/">here</a>. &nbsp; Then scroll about
halfway down to find "Netscape Communicator 4.5 ~ 4.8". &nbsp; I recommend
downloading version 4.8. &nbsp; This will take about three minutes if
using a university computer, longer if using a dial-up connection.)  <p>

<b>A. What is an "advanced construction"? </b><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term "advanced construction" is
intended to encompass those syntactic patterns or structures that are not
language-wide rules of grammar but at the same time are not so limited in
productivity as to be classed as idioms. Instances of "rules of grammar"
are the passive construction (1) or the use of the possessive to indicate
the subject of an infinitive (2): <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) <font size="+1" face="Xdvng">hm:
Vy:a kr&#240;&#248;</font> ? &nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font
size="+1" face="Xdvng">Vy:a eky:a j:aO</font>?<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What
shall we do?' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What shall be done?'
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">Es:s:&#240; p:hl:&#240; ek hm: l:a&#242;X&#240;&#248;</font>
...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">hm:ar&#240; l:a&#242;Xn:&#240; s:&#240; p:hl:&#240;</font>
... <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Before
we turn back ...' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Before our turning back ...' <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules of grammar are extremely
general, have thousands of possible lexical instantiations, are found in
nearly every description of a language, and are almost always covered in
the first or second year of formal instruction. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An "idiom" is a construction limited
to only one or two lexical instantiations.  Idioms are not usually
included in grammars. Often best treated as itself a kind of lexical item,
a given idiom may or may not be included in dictionaries.  Idioms are
numerous enough to preclude any general agreement about which ones are to
be included in a language course and which ones are best left out.  As an
example, consider (3).  The idiom in (3) has a single (invariant) lexical
instantiation: <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only some form of the verb (1) <font
size="+1" face="Xdvng">ha&#240;n:a</font> 'to be' and the noun (1) <font
size="+1" face="Xdvng">p:&#240;X</font> 'stomach, belly' can appear in it.
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) (<font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">v:h</font>)<font size="+1" face="Xdvng">p:&#240;X s:&#240;
h&#242; . </font> <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'She is
pregnant.' <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I term "advanced constructions"
lie between these two extremes: Less productive (or general) than rules of
grammar they are rarely if ever included in grammars. More productive than
idioms they are rarely if ever to be found in dictionaries. <br> <a
name=01730>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the construction in (4),
adapted from a headline in a newspaper (<font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">s:anDy: XaEmz:</font>, 9 July 1996): <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">da&#240;st: t:a&#240; da&#240;st:</font>, <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng"> b:ap: B:i m:dd d&#240;n:&#240; n:hi&#248; Aay:a . </font>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What to
say of his friends, even his father did not come to his aid.' <p>

The construction in (4) can be defined as in (5):  <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) NPi <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">t:a&#240;</font> NPi, NPj <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">B:i</font> X &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(where X
indicates the remainder of the sentence) <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The formula in (5) indicates that any
noun phrase (NPi), occurring twice and separated by <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">t:a&#240;</font>, can be used in the first part of the
construction, followed in the second part by a different noun phrase (NPj)
followed in turn by <font size="+1" face="Xdvng">B:i</font> and finally
the predicate. What the formula in (5) does not show is that there must be
a hierarchical relationship between the two noun phrases (NPi) and (NPj).
In (6) a cop is presumed more likely to be unscrupulous than a lawyer is:
<p>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">v:kil: t:a&#240; v:kil: p:&#216;el:es:y:&#240; B:i S:rif
en:kl:&#240; . </font> (Terry Varma, 18 Nov 1999) <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What to say of the lawyers, even the
police turned out to be gentlemen!' <p>

Another example found by Terry Varma (in a story for children) makes a
tongue-in-cheek comparison of men and money on a scale of their ability to
disappear in the big city: <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) <font size="+1" face="Xdvng">
p:aNR&#240; B:Ey:a y:h Ap:n:a g:a&#250;v: n:hi&#246;.
m:&#216;&#246;b:I h&#242; m:&#216;&#246;b:I j:ha&#250;  p:&#242;s:&#240;
t:a&#240; p:&#242;s:&#240; Ens:an: B:i K:a&#240; j:at:&#240;
h&#242;&#246;.</font> (Terry Varma, 19 April 2000) <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Brother
Pande, this is not our village. This is Bombay. Bombay! Forget about
money, even human beings disappear here!' <p>

In (8) a snake outranks a snakeskin on a natural scale of dangerousness;
in (9) death outranks Holi in fearsomeness: <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">s:a&#250;p: t:a&#240; s:a&#250;p:</font>, <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">k&#241;&#246;c:l:i s:&#240; B:i Rrt:a h&#242; . </font>
(Omkar N. Koul, 10 July 1996) <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'What to
say of a snake, he's even afraid of a snake's skin!' <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">ha&#240;l:i t:a&#240; ha&#240;l:i m:&#242;&#246; m:a&#242;t:
s:&#241; B:i n:hi&#246; Rrt:a </font>!  (thanks to Terry Varma) <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Holi? I
am not afraid of death itself!' <p>

If the two noun phrases cannot be seen as related and as occupying two
successive points on some kind of scale in a way that is natural and
relevant to the speaker's intent, the use of the construction in (5) is
meaningless. Compare (8) with (10): <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10) *? <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">k&#241;&#246;c:l:i t:a&#240; k&#241;&#246;c:l:i</font>, <font
size="+1" face="Xdvng">s:a&#250;p:  s:&#240; B:i Rrt:a h&#242; . </font>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*? 'What
to say of a snakeskin, he's even afraid of a snake!' <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is semantic considerations such as
these that limit the productivity of "advanced constructions" and render
them less general than rules of grammar.  On the other hand, they are far
more productive than idioms: Only the noun <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">p:&#240;X</font> fits into the idiom in example (3) while the
pairs of noun phrases that can be fitted into (5) cannot be listed or
enumerated. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, since idioms require the
presence of specific content words, dictionaries can be made of them. In
contrast, constructions, which are often simply semantic frames defined by
function words, cannot be easily arranged or accessed in dictionaries. <p>

<b>B. Advanced constructions and conversational transactions. </b><p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my objectives in the Mellon
Project is to develop as complete a list as possible of advanced
Hindi-Urdu constructions, to find copious examples of them from as diverse
a set of sources as possible, to order them in terms of importance, to
categorize them in terms of their semantic and discoursal functions, and
to identify the limits and conditions on their use. I am doing this by
pursuing them in printed as well as "live" sources and by discussing their
meanings and productivity with native speakers of Hindi-Urdu and with
Indian colleagues in the field of Hindi-Urdu linguistics and language
pedagogy. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the striking results that has
emerged from this work is the discovery that the constructions collected
and characterized so far fall into a limited number of classes defined by
their functions in actual or imagined conversations. Some advance the
speaker's position in a conversation.  The construction in (5) is an
example of this. Others of them try to limit the damage to the speaker's
position from a point advanced by an interlocutor. These are constructions
that concede a point to the interlocutor (who may be only an imagined
presence) but which regroup or which reaffirm some crucial point important
to the speaker. Consider (11) and (12): <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11) <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">)D:an:m:n*:i B:l:&#240; p:&#216;v:a&#240;&#252;&#182;:r
m:&#240;&#246; ha&#240;&#246;</font>, <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">v:ha&#250; k&#241; l:a&#240;g: n:hi&#248; j:an:t:&#240; .
</font> (<font size="+1" face="Xdvng">n:v:B:art: XaEmz:</font>, 22 May
1997) <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The PM
may very well be in the Northeast; people living there remain unaware of
it.' <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) <font size="+1" face="Xdvng">y:ad
rK:</font>, <font size="+1" face="Xdvng">py:ar&#240;</font>; <font
size="+1" face="Xdvng">l:aK: Am:rika rha&#240;</font>, <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">t:&#216;mhari m:&#248;ez:l: B:i y:hi&#248; h&#242;</font>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Remember,
Dear; no matter how long you stay in America, your home is also right
here.' <p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples (11) and (12) are
instances of different advanced constructions which are parallel in
conversational function (both concede one point then assert or reassert a
second) and in form (each has a positive indicator of concession [<font
size="+1" face="Xdvng">B:l:&#240;</font> 'good'; <font size="+1"
face="Xdvng">l:aK:</font> '100,000'] and a subjunctive form of the verb).
Recognition and analysis of these parallels will permit a more focussed
and transparent approach to language pedagogy, one that stresses
developing learners' competence in using structures to do things that will
help them cope with the challenges of transactional conversation. <p>
