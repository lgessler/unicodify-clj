<center>Discriminating the passive and the antitransitive.</center> <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; When looking up an antitransitive (see <a
href="derintrans.html">notes</a>) like &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">D:&#216;l:</font>&nbsp; or &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">k&#217;X</font>&nbsp; in a Hindi-Hindi dictionary, one often
finds a passive like &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">D:a&#240;y:a j:a</font>,
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">k&#221;Xa j:a</font>&nbsp; given as definition.
It is true that the one can sometimes be substituted for the other.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; / &nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">D:a&#240;O j:a
s:k&#241;&#249;g:&#240;.</font><br>

&nbsp;1. &nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">Et:n:&#240; s:&#240; p:an:i
m:&#240;&#248; y:&#240; s:ar&#240; kp:_&#240; n:hi&#248;</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">D:&#216;l:
s:k&#241;&#249;g:&#240;.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'This is not enough water to wash all these
clothes.'<p>

However, there are distinct differences. These can be summed up by saying
that the subject of a passive is still felt to be the patient of an action
while the subject of an antitransitive seems more like an agent.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; The clearest reflection of this is the possibility of
retaining &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">ka&#240;</font>&nbsp; with the subjects
of passives (see <a href="passive.html">notes</a> on passives):<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">Es: Q:t:  
ka&#240;</font> &nbsp; \ <br>

&nbsp;2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <font
face="Xdvng">p:&#216;el:s: Ensp:&#240;VXr k&#241; p:as: fa&#242;rn:
p:h&#216;&#250;c:a edy:a j:aO.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
<font face="Xdvng">y:h Q:t:</font> &nbsp; / <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Make sure this letter gets to the chief of police
right away.'<p>

The retention of &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">ka&#240;</font>&nbsp; is
impossible for the subjects of antitransitives: <p>

&nbsp;3.&nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">y:h Q:t: p:&#216;el:s: Ensp:&#240;VXr
k&#241; p:as: fa&#242;rn: p:h&#216;&#250;c: j:aO.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; The subject of an antitransitive is felt to be more
responsible for the action than is the subject of a passive. The former
can appear with &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">Ap:n:&#240; Aap:</font>&nbsp; ;  
the latter cannot :<p>

&nbsp;4.&nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">py:ael:y:a&#250; Ap:n:&#240; Aap:  
X&#220;X j:at:i h&#242;&#248;</font>, &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">m:&#240;m:s:ahb:.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The cups break all by themselves, Ma'am.'<p>

This can be uttered by the very party guilty of breaking the cups. By
contrast, the passive leaves the responsibility for the action with the
'real' performer (even though he is usually not mentioned). Thus, adverbs
like &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">j:an:</font>-<font
face="Xdvng">b:&#220;J:kr</font>&nbsp;, which refer back to an implied
agent, may occur with a passive but not with an antitransitive:<p>

&nbsp;5.&nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">m:&#242;&#248; kht:i h&#220;&#250; ek
py:ael:y:a&#250; j:an:</font>-<font face="Xdvng">b:&#220;J:kr t:a&#240;_i
j:at:i h&#242;&#248;.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I say the cups are being broken on purpose.'<p>

Similarly, those conjunctives which are used as a kind of adverb of manner
(see NNN) can be used only with passives: <p>

&nbsp;6.&nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">hT:a&#242;_i m:arkr s:ari
b:a&#240;t:l:&#240;&#248;  Pa&#240;_i g:I&#248;.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'All the bottles were broken with a hammer.'<p>

To add &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">hT:a&#242;_i m:arkr</font>&nbsp; to the
antitransitive &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:ari b:a&#240;t:l:&#240;&#248;  
P&#221;X g:o</font>&nbsp; would have the effect of endowing bottles
with arms and suicidal intentions.<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; However, &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">Ap:n:a</font>&nbsp;  
usually refers back to an implied agent regardless of whether the verb is
a passive or an antitransitive :<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; / &nbsp;
<font face="Xdvng">b:&#240;c:&#240; n:hi&#248; j:at:&#240;.</font><br>

&nbsp;7.&nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">Ap:n:a p:&#240;X B:rn:&#240;  k&#241;
el:y:&#240; b:cc:&#240;</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp;
<font face="Xdvng">n:hi&#248; eb:kt:&#240;</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'You don't sell your children just to fill your
stomach.'<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Since the subject of an antitransitive is felt in some sense
to be the agent of its action, the modal verb &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">p:a</font>&nbsp; 'manage to, be able to' may occur with
it:<p>

&nbsp;8.&nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">eds:mb:r ka&#240; D:im:i D:&#220;p:  
s:&#240; Aadm:i k&#241; haT: es:&#248;k n:hi&#248; p:at:&#240;.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The December sun is too weak to warm a man's 
hands.' <p>

With the passive the occurrence of &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">p:an:a</font>&nbsp; is impossible; only &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">s:kn:a</font>&nbsp; may occur :<p>

&nbsp;9.&nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">A&#248;g:iYi k&#241; p:as: b:&#242;Ykr
p:&#242;r n:hi&#248; s:&#240;&#249;k&#241; j:a s:kt:&#240;  
h&#242;&#248;.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'You can't warm your feet sitting near the hibachi.' 
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; An Antitransitive may occur as a conjunctive; a passive may
not :<p>

10.&nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">us:k&#241; da&#250;t: Q:&#220;b: m:&#250;j:kr
c:m:kn:&#240; l:g:&#240;.</font><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Her teeth, having been well scoured, began to
shine.' &nbsp; &nbsp; (In India teeth are often scoured <br> &nbsp;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; with a black powder applied with the forefinger
rather than with a brush.)<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Some speakers feel that there is a subtle difference in
meaning between the passive and the antitransitive of incapacity : The
first may express unwillingness while the second expresses physical
inability :<p>

11a. <font face="Xdvng">didi ka&#240; p:a&#242;T:&#240; Et:n:&#240; p:s:nd
h&#242;&#248; ek us:s:&#240; uK:a_&#240; n:hi&#248; j:at:&#240;.</font>
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Didi can't bear to pull up the plants. (She
likes them so much.)'<p>

11b. <font face="Xdvng">didi Et:n:i km:z:a&#240;r h&#242; ek us:s:&#240;  
p:a&#242;T:&#240; n:hi&#248; uK:_t:&#240;.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Didi can't pull up the plants. (She is so
weak.)'<p>

This difference must, of course, disappear where the choice of using the
antitransitive does not exist :<p>

12. &nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">m:&#216;J:s:&#240; g:ay: ka d&#220;D: ep:y:a
n:hi&#248; j:at:a.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'I can't stand cows milk.' (Either I don't
like it or I get sick from it.)<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Bear in mind that while only some transitive verbs have
corresponding antitransitives, all transitives and all intransitives (with
the exception of the antitransitive themselves) are potentially
passivizable. When a verb is passivized its grammar is changed but its
meaning is not. Thus &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">l:ada j:a</font>&nbsp; has
no meanings other than those of &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">l:ad</font>. The
antitransitive &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">l:ad</font>&nbsp;, however, shows
more autonomy. It can be used as an alternate to &nbsp;<font
face="Xdvng">l:ada j:a</font>&nbsp; in the meaning 'be loaded' but it also
can be used in contexts impossible for &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">l:ada
j:a</font>&nbsp; :<p>

13.&nbsp; <font face="Xdvng">p:&#240;_ p:k&#241; h&#216;O
Aam:a&#240;&#248; s:&#240; l:d&#240; T:&#240;.</font><br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The trees were laden with ripe mangos.'<p>

Here &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">l:d</font>&nbsp; cannot be directly derived
from &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">l:ad</font>&nbsp;, since there is no
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">l:adn:&#240;v:al:a</font>&nbsp;. Other autonomous
meanings of &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">l:d</font>&nbsp; include 'die' and
'go to jail'.<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With a bit of effort one may imagine how a 
derivative of 'load' developed these divergent secondary meanings. 
&nbsp;What is important to realize is that in these autonomous meanings 
erstwhile antitransitives lose the special properties that distinguish 
them from ordinary intransitives: &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">Ap:n:a</font> 
&nbsp;refers only to the subject, not to an implied agent: <br>

&nbsp;14. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">Ap:n:a p:&#240;X B:rn:&#240; k&#241; 
el:O hi As:l:i d&#240;S:B:Vt: d&#216;Sm:n: k&#241; haT:a&#240;&#248; 
m:&#240;&#248; n:hi&#248; eb:kt:&#240;.</font> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'True patriots do not sell out to the enemy simply to 
fill their stomachs.' &nbsp;[Compare (7).]<p>

And conjunctives of manner may occur: <p>

&nbsp;15. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">t:&#216;m: j:an:</font>-<font 
face="Xdvng">b:&#220;J:kr kX g:y:&#240;.</font> <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'You avoided (us) on purpose.' &nbsp;[Compare (5).] 
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Indeed secondary meanings may come close to 
crowding out the original meaning of an antitransitive. &nbsp;Thus, 
&nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">es:m:X</font>, the antitransitive of &nbsp;<font 
face="Xdvng">s:m:&#240;X</font> &nbsp;'collect', only rarely occurs as a 
synonym of &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">s:m:&#240;Xa j:a</font> : <br>

&nbsp;16. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">m:hri s:&#240; y:&#240; s:ari 
b:al:eXy:a&#250; Ok hi b:ar m:&#240;&#248; n:hi&#248; s:m:&#240;Xi 
j:aO&#251;g:i</font> &nbsp;( ? <font 
face="Xdvng">es:m:X&#240;&#248;g:i</font> ) <font face="Xdvng">.</font> 
<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 'The kitchen maid won't be able to collect all these 
buckets in one trip.' <p>

Usually &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">es:m:X</font> &nbsp;means 'shrink (in 
fear)': <p>

&nbsp;17. &nbsp;<font face="Xdvng">A&#250;D:&#240;r&#240; m:&#240;&#248; 
c:&#220;h&#240; ki l:al: Aa&#250;K:&#240;&#248; d&#240;K:kr v:h 
k&#217;rs:i m:&#240;&#248; es:m:X g:y:a.</font> <p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'Seeing the rat's red eyes in the dark, he shrank into 
his chair.' <p>
