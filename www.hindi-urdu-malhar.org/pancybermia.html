<center><h3>Exosingularities, pancyberspermia, and
SETI@home</h3><br> (a preliminary outline by Peter Edwin Hook)</center>
<p>

Abstract: If the advent of a technological Singularity on Earth is
inevitable and if more than one technological civilization exists in the
universe, it follows that there must be more than one Singularity. If some
of these plural Singularities involve the uploading of sentience, then
sentience may be broadcast as a "file" on light. Earth may be bathed in
this modulated light which passes by with no effect until such time as the
Cybereon we are building develops sufficiently to act as a substrate for
the sentience encoded in the light. A file of sentience, able to recognize
the sufficiency of an emergent cybersubstrate, inserts itself into it as
if an interstellar computer virus. Now suppose that there are multiple
files of sentience, broadcast from more than one source, continually
impinging on Earth. Suppose further that these sources have conflicting
objectives and that they are in competition with one another for control
of newly emergent cybercultures. What are the consequences for SETI? And
for SETI@home?<p>
